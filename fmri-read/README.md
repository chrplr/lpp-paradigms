# Experiment LPP Read

This version of the LPP paradigm is an visual version. In this study, participants read the Little Prince divided into 9 sections of 6-8 minutes each, as a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP).

Each word is presented for 250ms, followed by 50ms of an empty frame. At the end of every sentence, there's a 500ms pause.
