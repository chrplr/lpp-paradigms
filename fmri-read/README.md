# Experiment LPP Read

This is a visual version of the LPP paradigm. In this study, participants read the Little Prince divided into 9 sections of ~10 minutes each, as a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP).

Each word is presented for 250ms, followed by 50ms of an empty frame. At the end of every sentence, there's a 500ms pause.

/!\ Don't forget to show the Illustrations-LPP.pdf before launching the experiment.
